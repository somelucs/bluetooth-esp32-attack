# bluetooth-esp32-attack
## Purpose

This repository contains materials demonstrating how a Bluetooth-capable microcontroller (ESP32 family) can present itself as a Human Interface Device (HID). The intent is educational: to help security researchers, defenders, and developers understand HID-related attack vectors so they can build better protections and detection.

This README intentionally omits instructions and code that would facilitate performing unauthorized attacks.

## Disclaimer & Legal / Ethical Requirements

Do not use this repository to attack devices that you do not own or do not have explicit, written authorization to test. Doing so may violate criminal and civil laws.

If you are a security professional or researcher, obtain written permission from the asset owner and follow your organisation’s rules of engagement.

Follow responsible disclosure if you discover vulnerabilities.

The repository owner and contributors are not responsible for misuse of the information. Use at your own risk and within applicable law.

## High-level overview

Goal: Explore how an ESP32 can emulate HID devices over Bluetooth and demonstrate the potential impact in a controlled environment.

Scope: High-level examples of HID device enumeration and interaction for research purposes only. No attack payloads or step-by-step exploitation guidance are provided here.

## Architecture (high level):

ESP32 board running firmware that enumerates as a Bluetooth HID device.

Target machine discovers and connects to the ESP32 HID profile.

Controlled test harness (virtual machines, isolated network) is used to observe behavior safely.

Intended audience

Security researchers performing authorized testing.

Developers and product teams who want to better understand Bluetooth HID attack surface and defensive controls.

Educators teaching secure embedded development and defensive security.

## Hardware & software requirements (benign, non-actionable)

An ESP32-series development board with Bluetooth support (e.g., ESP32-WROOM or equivalent).

A host machine for development with:

Arduino IDE or PlatformIO (for building firmware).

ESP32 board support package installed.

Tools for safe testing:

Virtual machines (VMs) to run target OS images (e.g., Windows VM snapshots).

Isolated network (air-gapped or physically separated) to prevent unintended interaction with other devices.

## Safe lab setup (recommended)

To minimize risk, follow these defensive testing controls:

Use air-gapped or physically isolated test networks — never test on production or open networks.

Always run target OSes inside virtual machines with snapshots so you can quickly revert.

Disable any wireless interfaces on non-test machines to avoid accidental pairing or discovery.

Keep a detailed log of testing, scope, and signed authorization documents.

If you’re experimenting in a university or corporate environment, do so under a supervised lab policy and with IRB/ethics approval if necessary.

## Build & deployment (high level — no attack payloads)

This section describes building and flashing firmware in general terms without including exploit code or payloads.

Install development environment

Install Arduino IDE or PlatformIO.

Add ESP32 board support packages per the ESP-IDF / Arduino-ESP32 instructions.

Open the example project

The repository contains a firmware sketch (e.g., attack.ino). This sketch demonstrates HID enumeration behavior for research and defensive testing.

Review the code for safety and remove or disable any code that would send inputs or commands to a host machine.

## Build & flash

Select your ESP32 board in the IDE.

Compile and flash the firmware to your ESP32 using the standard USB programming method.

Validate the device enumerates as an HID-capable peripheral in an isolated VM.

Note: The repository intentionally excludes step-by-step attack payloads or scripts that could be used to compromise systems.

## Testing & validation (defensive guidance)

Focus testing on observability and detection rather than exploitation:

Use VMs to observe pairing, HID enumeration, and Windows / host logs.

Monitor host OS audit logs and Bluetooth stack logs to see how the device appears and what events are generated on pairing.

Validate that endpoint protection and host-based intrusion detection systems correctly flag or block unexpected HID devices.

Create detection signatures that look for unusual HID device names, unexpected Bluetooth addresses, or ephemeral pairing behavior.

## Defensive recommendations & mitigations

If your goal is to strengthen systems against malicious HID devices, consider:

Enforcing strict device-pairing policies (prevent auto-pairing).

Using endpoint protection that monitors for unexpected HID devices and blocks them.

Requiring administrative approval for pairing new Bluetooth peripherals.

Implementing host-side logging and alerting for new input devices.

Disabling or restricting Bluetooth on high-risk endpoints where not required.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome if they adhere to the following:

All changes must prioritize safety and responsible research.

No additions that enable or demonstrate unauthorized attacks (payloads, scripts, exploit content).

Include documentation describing defensive, detection, or research-focused use-cases.

Submit pull requests with tests and clear justification of educational/defensive value.
